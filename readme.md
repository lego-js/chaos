I think we can all agree that it is important to stick to a naming convention for a project. The problem is there are a lot out there and I don't think any one is "best" it all comes down to your team's preference.

The reality is we use 3rd party libraries in our projects and rarely do they all happen to stick to the same convention. I stick to a naming convention, but by no means do I think it's the *only* convention worth using. It's just the one *I* happen to like best.

The thought came to mind: Wouldn't it be great if I could choose my JS Libs independant of my naming conventions? I'll be honest, it influences me a lot. You could have some great logic tucked in there, but if I'm not crazy about the convention, I might do a little more shopping before I settle on your lib.

And with that Chaos was born! ...Chaos? I don't want chaos, I want sanity! I chose the name Chaos because in Greek mythology Chaos was the nothing that everything was born from.

> You had me at Greek mythology

Chaos is a small lib that allows you to abstract selectors and just worry about logic. The user can either pick from a predifined naming convention or define their own.

### But wait, how do I ship my lib styles with such a concept?

In my experience, overly styled libraries are a pain to incorporate into my own project. It's rare that to overly styled libs ever look very good sitting next to eachother. In the thread of giving more power to the consumer, the idea is that your JS is not coupled with much, if any styles.
